## List of customizations I plan on implementing.

## Main Menu
```
Adding gradients to main menu buttons
Adding custom icons to main menu buttons
Relocating the XPBar to the bottom of the screen, just above BackgroundFooter
Relocating the elements of pvprankpanel.res on the bottom of the screen
Creating a custom TF2 logo
Adding custom buttons for reloading the hud, opening the console, map itemtest and map tr_walkway
Adding custom character images as shown in the main menu concept
Installing gobold typeface and replacing certain main menu fonts with it
Adding player stats
Relocating buttons at the bottom of the screen
Adjusting the wide & tall values of steamfriendslist for a more compact look
Adding a background to all menu items placed on BackgroundFooter to improve readability
```

Might change other elements in the future. Right now I just want to finish the main menu.
